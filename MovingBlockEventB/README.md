This directory contains machines created by EBSysMLSec. One needs to import these machines into Rodin and create a refinement chain that includes refining events in AbstractMachine.  
EBSysMLSec creates one context which is an extension of all contexts provided here.

Note that machines do not show the invariants defined as a result of rely-guarantee style.
